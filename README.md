IFeedly is a news feed application containing a list of posts users can interact with.

### Technologies I've used

- Web Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- CSS Framework: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- HTTP Client: [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- Asynchronous State Management: [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- Auth Framework: [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- Motion Library: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

### Challenges

#### Virtualization

I have implemented efficient rendering of large lists of posts using Tanstack's virtualization, which significantly improved the application's performance and user experience by reducing the number of DOM elements rendered at any given time.
